This script is a demonstration of using the CGI.pm library
in an ASP script.  Please remember that using CGI.pm will 
probably NOT be portable with PScript and PerlScript.
<p>
As of version 0.09, you may use CGI for reading form input
without any change to regular use of CGI.  Before, you couldn't
do a <pre> use CGI; </pre> by itself, as it would try to read
form input that had already been loaded into $Request->Form().
Form input is now cached, and may be loaded into CGI as well.
In short, use of CGI.pm is now transparent in Apache::ASP,
as both output and input have been merged seemlessly.
