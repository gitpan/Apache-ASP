  As we have seen with WebTime, Apache::ASP is not only good  for the
  development of website, but also for the development of webtools. Since
  I first discoverd it, I made it a must-have in my society by taking
  traditional PHP users to the world of perl afficionados.
  <p>
  Having the possibility to use Apache::ASP with mod_perl or mod_cgi make
  it constraintless to use because of CGI's universality and perl's
  portability.

  <site:testimonial from="David Kulp" >
  First, I just want to say that I am very very impressed with Apache::ASP.  I
  just want to gush with praise after looking at many other implementations of
  perl embedded code and being very underwhelmed.  This is so damn slick and
  clean.  Kudos! ...
  <p>
  ... I'm very pleased how quickly I've been able to mock
  up the application.  I've been writing Perl CGI off and on since 1993(!)
  and I can tell you that Apache::ASP is a pleasure.  (Last year I tried
  Zope and just about threw my computer out the window.)

Working in a team environment where you have HTML coders and perl
coders, Apache::ASP makes it easy for the HTML folks to change the look
of the page without knowing perl. Using Apache::ASP (instead of another
embedded perl solution) allows the HTML jockeys to use a variety of HTML
tools that understand ASP, which reduces the amount of code they break
when editing the HTML.  Using Apache::ASP instead of M$ ASP allows us to
use perl (far superior to VBScript) and Apache (far superior to IIS).
<p>
We've been very pleased with Apache::ASP and its support.

    >
Apache::ASP has been a great tool.  Just a little
background.... the whole site had been in cgi flat files when I started
here.  I was looking for a technology that would allow me to write the
objects and NEVER invoke CGI.pm... I found it and hopefuly I will be able to
implement this every site I go to.
<p>
    When I got here there was a huge argument about needing a game engine
and I belive this has been the key... Games are approx. 10 time faster than
before. The games don't break anylonger. All in all a great tool for
advancement.

    ...we ported our biggest yet ASP site from IIS (well, actually rewrote),
    <b><a href=http://www.cine.gr>www.cine.gr</a></b> and it is a killer site. 
    In some cases, the whole thing got almost 25 (no typo) times faster...
    None of this would ever be possible without Apache::ASP (I do not ever want to write ``print "<HTML>\n";''
    again).
