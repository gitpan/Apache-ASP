  <site:testimonial from="David Kulp" >
  First, I just want to say that I am very very impressed with Apache::ASP.  I
  just want to gush with praise after looking at many other implementations of
  perl embedded code and being very underwhelmed.  This is so damn slick and
  clean.  Kudos! ...
  <p>
  ... I'm very pleased how quickly I've been able to mock
  up the application.  I've been writing Perl CGI off and on since 1993(!)
  and I can tell you that Apache::ASP is a pleasure.  (Last year I tried
  Zope and just about threw my computer out the window.)

Working in a team environment where you have HTML coders and perl
coders, Apache::ASP makes it easy for the HTML folks to change the look
of the page without knowing perl. Using Apache::ASP (instead of another
embedded perl solution) allows the HTML jockeys to use a variety of HTML
tools that understand ASP, which reduces the amount of code they break
when editing the HTML.  Using Apache::ASP instead of M$ ASP allows us to
use perl (far superior to VBScript) and Apache (far superior to IIS).
<p>
We've been very pleased with Apache::ASP and its support.

     ...<b><a href="http://www.planetofmusic.com">www.planetofmusic.com</a></b> 
     is running Apache::ASP. so far so good... thousands of hits a day 
     and it doesn't blink an eye...

    ...we ported our biggest yet ASP site from IIS (well, actually rewrote),
    <b><a href=http://www.cine.gr>www.cine.gr</a></b> and it is a killer site. 
    In some cases, the whole thing got almost 25 (no typo) times faster...
    None of this would ever be possible without Apache::ASP (I do not ever want to write ``print "<HTML>\n";''
    again).
