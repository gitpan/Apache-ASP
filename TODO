IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
=======================
There is no specific time frame in which these things will be 
implemented.  Please let me know if any of these is of particular
interest to you, and I will give it higher priority.

WILL BE DONE 
============
- Extend internal SSI include handling
- asp.pl, CGI method of doing asp
- Full ASP API, let me know what features you need, and they will be 
  priority over misc API work.

MAY BE DONE
===========
- Get filtering to work for Apache::SSI -> Apache::ASP, it only
  works the other way around right now.
- VBScript, ECMAScript interpreters
- allow use of Http::Session for session management
- Integration with HTML::Embed
- Cache Scripts LRU style, so large sites won't choke server
	: NoCache setting might be enough.
- General PerlScript porting work.
	: I have already done much porting work.  Please read the 
	  the PerlScript section of the README.  If you are having
	  problems with a port, or forsee any, please let me know
	  and we'll work things out.
