IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
=======================
There is no specific time frame in which these things will be 
implemented.  Please let me know if any of these is of particular
interest to you, and I will give it higher priority.

WILL BE DONE 
============
- $Request->ClientCertificate()
- asp.pl, CGI method of doing asp
- Investigating possibility of hooking $Session timeout into 
  client/server 401 authentication failure.  Seems like IE 
  caches passwords which makes things tough

MAY BE DONE
===========
- VBScript, ECMAScript interpreters
- allow use of Http::Session for session management
- Integration with HTML::Embed
- Dumping state of Apache::ASP during an error, and being
  able to go through it with the perl debugger.
