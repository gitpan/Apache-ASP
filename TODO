IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
=======================
There is no specific time frame in which these things will be 
implemented.  Please let me know if any of these is of particular
interest to you, and I will give it higher priority.

WILL BE DONE 
============
- Try to get pre-compiling and statinc module reloading into the 
  parent httpd prefork, so it can be shared with the children.
- MailErrorsPower, sends duplicate errors every 1,10,100... occurances
- MailErrorsPowerPeriod, resets the duplicate errors counter.
- $Request->ClientCertificate()
- asp.pl, CGI method of doing asp
- Investigating possibility of hooking $Session timeout into 
  client/server 401 authentication failure.  Seems like IE 
  caches passwords which makes things tough
- BerkeleyDB2 integration for state management, maybe getting
  shared memory to work.
- Better debugging, line numbers for dynamic includes.  
  Maybe also some lightweight syntax error checking.

MAY BE DONE
===========
- Session management w/o cookies.
- VBScript, ECMAScript interpreters
- allow use of Apache::Session for session management
- Close integration with HTML::Embperl
- Dumping state of Apache::ASP during an error, and being
  able to go through it with the perl debugger.
