NAME
    Apache::ASP - Active Server Pages for Apache (all platforms)

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a Active Server Pages port to Apache.
    Active Server Pages is a web application platform that
    originated with Microsoft's IIS server. Under Apache for both
    Win32 and Unix, it allows a developer to create web applications
    with session management and perl embedded in static html files.

    This is a portable solution, similar to ActiveWare's PerlScript
    and MKS's PScript implementation of perl for IIS ASP.
    Theoretically, one should be able to take a solution that runs
    under Apache::ASP and run it without change under PerlScript or
    PScript for IIS.

CONFIG
    Use with Apache. Copy the /eg directory from the ASP
    installation to your Apache document tree and try it out! You
    have to put

    AllowOverride All

    in your <Directory> config section to let the .htaccess file in
    the /eg installation directory do its work.

    Here is a sample config in a *.conf Apache configuration file
    that works, if you want to skip the /eg installation:

<Location /asp/>    
    ## mandatory
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Apache::ASP
    PerlSendHeader On
    Options ExecCGI 

    ## optional flags
    PerlSetVar Debug 0
    PerlSetVar Global c:/tmp
    PerlSetVar CookiePath /
    PerlSetVar NoSession 0
    PerlSetVar SessionTimeout 20
</Location>

    You can use the same config in .htaccess files without the
    Location tag. I use the <Files ~ (\.asp)> tag in the .htaccess
    file of the directory that I want to run my asp application.
    This allows me to mix other file types in my application, static
    or otherwise.

ASP Syntax
    ASP embedding syntax allows one to embed code in html in 2
    simple ways. The first is the <% xxx %> tag in which xxx is any
    valid perl code. The second is <%= xxx %> where xxx is some
    scalar value that will be inserted into the html directly. An
    easy print.

    A simple asp page would look like:

	<!-- sample here -->
	<html>
	<body>
	For loop incrementing font size: <p>
	<% for(1..5) { %>
		<!-- iterated html text -->
		<font size="<%=$_%>" > Size = <%=$_%> </font> <br>
	<% } %>
	</body>
	</html>
	<!-- end sample here -->

    Notice that your perl code blocks can span any html. The for
    loop above iterates over the html without any special syntax.

The Object Model
    The beauty of the ASP Object Model is that it takes the brunt of
    the burden of CGI and Session Management off the developer, and
    puts them in objects accessible from any ASP page. For the perl
    programmer, treat these objects as globals accesible from
    anywhere in your ASP application.

    Currently the Apache::ASP object model supports the following
    objects:

	Object		--	Function
	------			--------
	$Response	--	output
	$Request	--	input
	$Application	--	application state
	$Session	--	session state

    These objects, and their methods are further defined in the
    following sections.

MORE
    I'll put more info on objects here soon.
