 + Improved ./site/apps/search application, for better
   search results at Apache::ASP site.  Also, reengineered
   application better, with more perl code moved to global.asa.
   Make use of MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, where search database
   before was engineering around SDBM_File's shortcomings.

 - Fix for SessionSerialize config, which broke in 2.23
   Also, added t/session_serialize.t to test suite to catch
   this problem in the future.
