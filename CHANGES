$MODULE=Apache::ASP; $VERSION = 2.21; $DATE="8/5/2001";

Please see README for changes for past versions.

 + = improvement; - = bug fix

 +Documented RequestParams config in CONFIG misc section.

 +Documented new XSLT caching directives.

 +Updated ./site/eg/.htaccess XSLT example config
  to use XSLTCache setting.

 +New FAQ section on why perl variables are sticky globals,
  suggested by Mark Seger.

 -push Global directory onto @INC during ASP script execution
  Protect contents of original @INC with local.  This makes
  things compatible with .09 Apache::ASP where we always had
  Global in @INC.  Fixed needed by Henrik Tougaard

 - ; is a valid separator like & for QueryString Parameters
  Fixed wanted by Anders

 -XSMLSubsMatch doc fix in CONFIG section
 
 +Reduces number of Session groups to 16 from 32, so 
  session manager for small user sets will be that much faster.

 +optimizations for internal database, $Application, and $Session
  creation.

 +XSLTCache must be set for XSLT caching to begin using CacheDir

 +CacheDB like StateDB bug sets dbm format for caching, which
  defaults to MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, which works well for caching
  output sizes < 50K

 +CacheDir config for XSLT caching ... defaults to StateDir
 
 +CacheSize in bytes determines whether the caches in CacheDir
  are deleted at the end of the request.  A cache will be 
  reset in this way back to 0 bytes. Defaults to 10000000 bytes
  or about 10M.

 +Caching infrastructure work that is being used in XSLT
  can be leveraged later for output caching of includes,
  or arbitrary user caching.

 -t/server_mail.t test now uses valid email for testing
  purposes ... doesn't actually send a mail, but for SMTP
  runtime validation purposes it should be OK.

 +fixed where POST data was read from under MOD_PERL,
  harmless bug this was that just generated the wrong
  system debugging message.
