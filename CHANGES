+ Installation 'make test' now works
+ ActiveX objects on Win32 implemented with $Server->CreateObject() 
+ Cookies implemented: $Response->Cookies() & $Request->Cookies()
- Fixed $Response object API, converting some methods to object members.
  Deprecated methods, but backwards compatible.
+ Improved error messaging, debug output
+ $, influences $Response->Write(@strings) behavior
+ perl print() works, sending output to $Response object
+ $Response->Write() prints scalars, arrays, and hashes.  Before only scalars.
+ Begin implementation of $Server object.
+ Implemented $Response->{Expires} and $Response->{ExpiresAbsolute}
+ Added "PerlSetVar StatINC" config option
+ $0 is aliased to current script filename

$VERSION = .01;

Syntax Support
--------------
Intial realease, could be considered alpha software.
Allows developers to embed perl in html ASP style.

<!-- sample here -->
<html>
<body>
<% for(1..10) { %>
	counting: <%=$_%> <br>
<% } %>
</body>
</html>

ASP Objects
-----------
$Session, $Application, $Response, $Request objects available
for use in asp pages.

$Session & $Application data is preserved using SDBM files.

$Session id's are tracked through the use of cookies.

Security
--------
Timeouts any attempt to use a session id that doesn't already 
exist.  Should stop hackers, since there is no wire speed guessing
cookies.
