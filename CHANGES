Syntax Support

Intial realease, could be considered alpha software.
Allows developers to embed perl in html ASP style.

<!-- sample here -->
<html>
<body>
<% for(1..10) { %>
	counting: <%=$_%> <br>
<% } %>
</body>
</html>

ASP Objects
-----------
$Session, $Application, $Response, $Request objects available
for use in asp pages.

$Session & $Application data is preserved using SDBM files.

$Session id's are tracked through the use of cookies.

Security
--------
Timeouts any attempt to use a session id that doesn't already 
exist.  Should stop hackers, since there is no wire speed guessing
cookies.
