 + = improvement;    - = bug fix;    (d) = documentation

 -Fixed the testing directory structures for t/long_names.t
  so that tar software like Archive::Tar & Solaris tar that
  have problems with long file names will still be able 
  to untar distribution successfully.  Now t/long_names.t
  generates its testing directory structures at runtime.

 -Fixes for "make test" to work under perl 5.8.0 RC2,

 +SessionQueryForce setting created for disabling use of cookies
  for $Session session-id passing, rather requiring use of SessionQuery*
  functionality for session-id passing via URL query string.

  By default, even when SessionQuery* options are used, cookies will
  be used if available with SessionQuery* functionality acting only
  as a backup, so this makes it so that cookies will never be used.

 +Escape ' with HTMLEncode() to &#39;

 -Trying to fix t/server_mail.t to work better for platforms
  that it should skip testing on.  Updated t/server.t test case.

 +Remove exit() from Makefile.PL so CPAN.pm's automatic
  follow prereq mechanism works correctly.  Thanks to Slaven Rezic
  for pointing this out.

 +Added Apache::compat loading in mod_perl environment for better
  mod_perl 2.0 support.
