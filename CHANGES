$MODULE=Apache::ASP; $VERSION = 2.09; $DATE="01/30/2001";

Please see README for changes for past versions.

 + = improvement; - = bug fix

 +Examples in ./site/eg are now UseStrict friendly.  
  Also fixed up ssi_filter.ssi example.

 +Auto purge of old stale session group directories, increasing 
  session manager performance when using Sessions when migrating
  to Apache::ASP 2.09+ from older versions.

 +SessionQueryParse now works for all $Response->{ContentType}
  starting with 'text' ... before just worked with text/html,
  now other text formats like wml will work too. 

 +32 groups instead of 64, better inactive site session group purging.

 +Default session-id length back up to 32 hex bytes.
  Better security vs. performance, security more important,
  especially when performance difference was very little.

 +PerlSetVar RequestParams 1 creates $Request->Params
  object with combined contents of $Request->QueryString
  and $Request->Form

 ++FormFill feature via HTML::FillInForm.  Activate with
  $Response->{FormFill} = 1 or PerlSetVar FormFill 1
  See site/eg/formfill.asp for example.

 ++XMLSubs tags of the same name may be embedded in each other
  recursively now.

 +No umask() use on Win32 as it seems unclear what it would do

 +simpler Apache::ASP::State file handle mode of >> when opening 
  lock file.  saves doing a -e $file test.

 +AuthServerVariables config to init $Request->ServerVariables
  with basic auth data as documented.  This used to be default
  behavior, but triggers "need AuthName" warnings from recent
  versions of Apache when AuthName is not set.

 -Renamed Apache::ASP::Loader class to Apache::ASP::Load
  as it collided with the Apache::ASP->Loader() function
  namespace.  Class used internally by Apache::ASP->Loader()
  so no public API changed here.

 +-Read of POST input for $Request->BinaryRead() even
   if its not from a form.  Only set up $Request->Form
   if this is from a form POST.

 +faster POST/GET param parsing
