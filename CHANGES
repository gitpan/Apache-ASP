 + = improvement; - = bug fix

 -Fix for running under perl 5.6.1 by removing parser optimization
  introduced in 2.11.

 -Now file upload forms, forms with ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data"
  can have multiple check boxes and select items marked for 
  @params = $Request->Form('param_name') functionality.  This 
  will be demostrated via the ./site/eg/file_upload.asp example.
