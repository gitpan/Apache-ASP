 + = improvement; - = bug fix

 +Added ASP perl mmm-mode subclass and configuration
  in editors/mmm-asp-perl.el file for better emacs support.
  Updated SYNTAX/Editors documentation.

 +Better debugging error message for Debug 2 or 3 settings 
  for global.asa errors.  Limit debug output for lines
  preceding rendered script.

 -In old inline include mode, there should no longer
  be the error "need id for includes" when using
  $Response->Include() ... if DynamicIncludes were
  enabled, this problem would not have likely occured
  anyway.  DynamicIncludes are preferrable to use so
  that compiled includes can be shared between scripts.
  This bug was likely introduced in version 2.11.

 -Removed logging from $Response->BinaryWrite() in regular
  debug mode 1 or 2.  Logging still enabled in system Debug mode, -1 or -2

 -Removed other extra system debugging call that is really not
  necessary.
