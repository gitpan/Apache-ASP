 -- bug introduced in 2.47 cached script compilations for executing
    scripts ( not includes ), of the same name in different directories
    for the same Global/GlobalPackage config for an application.
    Fix was to remove optimization that caused problem, and
    created test case t/same_name.t to cover bug.
