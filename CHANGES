  scripts in CGI mode.  See CGI perldoc section for more info.
  The examples in ./site/eg have been set up to run
  in cgi mode if desired.  Configuration in CGI section
  only testing for Apache on Linux.

 - Fixed some faulty or out of date docs in XML/XSLT section.

 +added t/server_mail.t test for $Server->Mail(), requires
  Net::SMTP to be configured properly to succeed.

 +Net::SMTP debugging not enabled by Debug 1,2,3 configs,
  not only when system debugging is set with Debug -1,-2,-3
  However, a Debug param passed to $Server->Mail() will 
  sucessfully override the Debug -1,-2,-3 setting even
  when its Debug => 0

 +Check for undef values during stats for inline includes
  so we don't trigger unintialized warnings

 +Documented ; may separate many directories in the IncludesDir
  setting for creating a more flexible includes search path.
