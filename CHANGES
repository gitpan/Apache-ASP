 ++New XMLSubsPerlArgs config, default 1, indicates how 
  XMLSubs arguments have always been parsed.  If set to 0,
  will enable new XMLSubs args that are more ASP like with
  <%= %> for dynamic interpolation, such as:

    <my:xmlsub arg="<%= $data %>" arg2="text <%= $data2 %>" />
 
  Settings XMLSubsPerlArgs to 0 is experimental for now, but
  will become the default by Apache::ASP version 3.0

 ++Optimization for static HTML/XML files that are served up 
  via Apache::ASP so that they are not compiled into perl subroutines
  first.  This makes especially native XSLT both faster & take
  less memory to serve, before XSL & XML files being transformed
  by XSLT would both be compiled as normal ASP script first, so 
  now this will happen if they really are ASP scripts with embedded
  <% %> code blocks & XMLSubs being executed.

 +Consolidate some config data for Apache::ASP->Loader to use
  globals in @Apache::ASP::CompileChecksumKeys to know which 
  config data is important for precompiling ASP scripts.

 +Further streamlined code compilation.  Now both base
  scripts and includes use the internal CompileInclude() API
  to generate code.

 -Fixed runtime HTML error output when Debug is set to -2/2,
  so that script correctly again gets rendered in final perl form.
  Added compile time error output to ./site/eg/syntax_error.htm
  when a special link is clicked for a quick visual test.

 -Cleaned up some bad coding practices in ./site/eg/global.asa
  associated changes in other example files.  Comment example
  global.asa some for the first time reader

 -DemoASP.pm examples module needed "use strict" fix, thanks
  to Allan Vest for bug report

 --$rv = $Response->Include({ File => ..., Cache => 1});
  now works to get the first returned value fetched from
  the cache.  Before, because a list was always returned,
  $rv would have been equal to the number of items returned,
  even if the return value list has just one element.

 (d) added site/robots.txt file with just a comment for
     search engine indexing

 -fixed ./site/eg/binary_write.htm to not use 
  $Response->{ContentLength} because it does not exist.
  Fixed it to use $Response->AddHeader now instead
