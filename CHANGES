 + = improvement; - = bug fix

- sub second timing with Time::HiRes was adding <!-- -->
  comments by HTML by default, which would possibly
  break specific programs looking for precise HTML output.
  Now this behavior must be explicitly turned on with
  the TimeHiRes config setting.

  These comments will only appear in HTML only if 
  Debug is enabled as well.

  Timed log entries will only occur is Debug if 
  system debugging is enabled, with Debug -1 or -2
