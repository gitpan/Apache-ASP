 + = improvement;    - = bug fix;    (d) = documentation

 - Bug fixes for running on standalone CGI mode on Win32 submitted
   by Francesco Pasqualini

 + Added Apache::ASP::Request::BINMODE for binmode() being
   called on STDIN after STDIN is tied to $Request object

 + New RequestBinaryRead configuration created, may be turned off
   to prevent $Request object from reading POST data

 ++ mod_perl 2 optmizations, there was a large code impact on this,
  as much code was restructured to reduce the differences between
  mod_perl 1 and mod_perl 2

 + preloaded CGI for file uploads in the mod_perl environment

 - When XSLT config is set, $Response->Redirect() should work now
   Thanks to Marcus Zoller for pointing problem out

 + Added CookieDomain setting, documented, and added test to cover 
   it in t/cookies.t . Setting suggested by Uwe Riehm, who nicely 
   submitted some code for this.
