$MODULE=Apache::ASP; $VERSION = '2.51'; $DATE="TBD"

Please see README for changes for past versions.

 + = improvement;    - = bug fix;    (d) = documentation

 + added t/session_query_parse.t test to cover use of SessionQueryParse
   and $Server->URL APIs

 - Fixed duplicate "&" bug associated with using $Server->URL 
   and SessionQueryParse together

 + Patch to allow $Server->URL() to be called multiple times on the same URL
   as in $Server->URL($Server->URL($url, \%params), \%more_params)

 (d) Added new testimonials & sites & created a separate testimonials page.

 - SessionQueryParse will now add to &amp; to the query strings
   embedded in the HTML, instead of & for proper HTML generation.
   Thanks to Peter Galbavy for pointing out and Thanos Chatziathanassiou
   for suggesting the fix.

 - $Response->{ContentType} set to text/html for developer error reporting,
   in case this was set to something else before the error occured.
   Thanks to Philip Mak for reporting.

 - Couple of minor bug fixes under PerlWarn use, thanks Peter Galbavy
   for reporting.

 + Added automatic load of "use Apache2" for compat with mod_perl2 
   request objects when Apache::ASP is loaded via "PerlModule Apache::ASP"
   Thanks to Richard Curtis for reporting bug & subsequent testing.

 - When GlobalPackage config changes, but global.asa has not, global.asa
   will be recompiled anyway to update the GlobalPackage correctly.
   Changing GlobalPackage before would cause errors if global.asa was
   already compiled.

 ++ For ANY PerlSetVar type config, OFF/Off/off will be assumed 
    to have value of 0 for that setting.  Before, only a couple settings
    had this semantics, but they all do now for consistency.

 - Fix for InodeNames config on OpenBSD, or any OS that might have
   a device # of 0 for the file being stat()'d, thanks to Peter Galbavy
   for bug report.

 ++ Total XSLT speedups, 5-10% on large XSLT, 10-15% on small XSLT

 + bypass meta data check like expires for XSLT Cache() API use
   because XSLT tranformations don't expire, saves hit to cache dbm
   for meta data

 + use of direct Apache::ASP::State methods like FETCH/STORE
   in Cache() layer so we don't have to go through slower tied interface.
   This will speed up XSLT & and include output caching mostly.

 + minor optimizations for speed & memory usage
