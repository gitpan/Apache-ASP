$MODULE=Apache::ASP; $VERSION = 2.31; $DATE="01/22/2002";

Please see README for changes for past versions.

 + = improvement; - = bug fix

 + $Server->MapInclude() API extension created to wrap up Apache::ASP::SearchDirs functionality
   so one may do an conditional check for an include existence befor executing $Response->Include().
   Added API test to server.t

 + $Server->Transfer() now allows arguments like $Response->Include(), and now acts just
   as a wrapper for:

     $Response->Include($file, @args);
     $Response->End();

   added test case at t/server_transfer.t

 + Removed dependency of StatINC functionality on Apache::Symbol.  Apache::Symbol 
   is no longer required.  Added test of t/stat_inc.t for correct StatINC initialization
   for platforms where Devel::Symdump is present.

 + Better error message when $Request->Params has not been defined with RequestParams
   config & it gets used in script.  Added test case as t/request_params_none.t

 + Directories cannot now be included as scripts via $Response->Include(), added
   test case to t/include.t

 - No longer make $Response->Flush dependent on $Response->IsClientConnected() to 
   be true to write output to client.  There have been spurious errors reported
   about the new ( >= 2.25 ) IsClientConnected code, and this will limit the impact 
   of that functionality possibly not working still to those users explicitly using 
   that API.

 + $Response->AddHeader($header_name, $value) now will set $Response members
   for these headers: Content-Type, Cache-Control, Expires.  This is to avoid
   both the application & Apache::ASP sending out duplicate headers.  Added
   test cases for this to t/response.t

 + split up Bundle::Apache::ASP into that, and Bundle::Apache::ASP::Extra
   the former with just the required modules to run, and the latter 
   for extra functionality in Apache::ASP

 + new $Request->{Method} member to return $r->method of GET or POST that 
   client browser is requesting, added t/request.t sub test to cover this member.
