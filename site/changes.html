<font face="lucida console,courier new" size=3><pre>
 +Documented SessionQuery* &amp; $Server-&gt;URL() and
  cleaned up formatting some, as well as redoing
  some of the sections ordering for better readability.
  Document the cookieless session functionality more
  in a new <a href=cookies.html>COOKIES</a> section.  Also documented new
  FileUpload configs and $Request-&gt;FileUpload collection.
  Documented StatScripts.

 +StatScripts setting which if set to 0 will not reload
  includes, global.asa, or scripts when changed.

 +FileUpload filehandles cleanup at garbage collection
  time so developer does not have to worry about lazy coding
  and undeffing filehandles used in code.  Also set
  uploaded filehandles to binmode automatically on Win32
  platforms, saving the developer yet more typing.

 +FileUploadTemp setting, default 0, if set will leave
  a temp file on disk during the request, which may be
  helpful for processing by other programs, but is also
  a security risk in that others could potentially read
  this file while the script is running.

  The path to the temp file will be available at
  $Request-&gt;{FileUpload}{$form_field}{TempFile}.
  The regular use of file uploads remains the same
  with the &lt;$filehandle&gt; to the upload at
  $Request-&gt;{Form}{$form_field}.

 +FileUploadMax setting, default 0, currently an
  alias for $<a href=cgi.html>CGI</a>::POST_MAX, which determines the
  max size for a file upload in bytes.

 +SessionQueryParse only auto parses session-ids
  into links when a session-id COOKIE is NOT found.
  This feature is only enabled then when a user has
  disabled cookies, so the runtime penalty of this
  feature won't drag down the whole site, since most
  users will have cookies turned on.

 -StatINC &amp; StatINCMatch will not undef Fnctl.pm flock
  functions constants like O_RDWR, because the code references
  are not well trackable.  This would result in sporadic 500 server
  errors when a changed module was reloaded that imported O_* flock
  functions from Fnctl.

 +SessionQueryParse &amp; SessionQueryParseMatch
  settings that enable auto parsing session ids into
  URLs for cookieless sessions.  Will pick up URLs in
  &lt;a href&gt;, &lt;area href&gt;, &lt;form action&gt;, &lt;frame src&gt;,
  &lt;iframe src&gt;, &lt;img src&gt;, &lt;input src&gt;, &lt;link href&gt;
  $Response-&gt;Redirect($URL) and the first URL in
  script tags like &lt;script&gt;*.location.href=$URL&lt;/script&gt;

  These settings require that buffering be enabled, as
  Apache::ASP will parse through the buffer to parse the URLs.

  With SessionQueryParse on, it will just parse non-absolute
  URLs, but with SessionQueryParseMatch set to some server
  url regexp, like <a href=http://www.mysite.com,>http://www.mysite.com,</a> will also parse
  in the session id for URLs that match that.

  When testing, the performance hit from this parsing
  a script dropped from 12.5 hits/sec on my WinNT box
  to 11.7 hits per second for 1K of buffered output.
  The difference is .007 of my PII300's processing power
  per second.

  For 10K of output then, my guess is that this speed
  of script, would be slowed to 6.8 hits per second.
  This kind of performance hit would also slow a
  script running at 40 hits per second on a UNIX box
  to 31 hits/sec for 1K, and to 11 hits/sec for 10K parsed.

  Your mileage may vary and you will have to test the difference
  yourself.  Get yourself a valid URL with a session-id in
  it, and run it through ab, or socrates, with SessionQuery
  turned on, and then with SessionQueryParse set to see
  the difference.  SessionQuery just enables of session id
  setting from the query string but will not auto parse urls.

 -If buffering, Content-Length will again be set.
  It broke, probably while I was tuning in the past
  couple versions.

 +UseStrict setting compiles all scripts including
  global.asa with &quot;use strict&quot; turned on for catching
  more coding errors.  With this setting enableb,
  use strict errors die during compilation forcing
  Apache::ASP to try to recompile the script until
  successful.

 -Object use in includes like $Response-&gt;Write()
  no longer error with &quot;use strict&quot; programming.

 +SessionQuery config setting with $Server-&gt;URL($url, { %params } )
  alpha API extensions to enable cookieless sessions.

 +Debugging not longer produces internal debugging
  by default.  Set to -1,-2 for internal debugging
  for Debug settings 1 &amp; 2.

 +Both StateSerializer &amp; StateDB can be changed
  without affecting a live web site, by storing
  the configurations for $Application &amp; $Session
  in an internal database, so that if $Session was
  created with SDBM_File for the StateDB (default),
  it will keep this StateDB setting until it ends.

 +StateSerializer config setting.  Default Data::Dumper,
  can also be set to Storable.  Controls how data is
  serialized before writing to $Application &amp; $Session.

 +Beefed up the make test suite.

 +Improved the locking, streamlining a bit of the
  $Application / $Session setup process.  Bench is up to
  22 from 21 hits / sec on dev NT box.

 +Cut more fat for faster startup, now on my dev box
  I get 44 hits per sec Apache::ASP vs 48 Embperl
  vs 52 <a href=cgi.html>CGI</a> via Apache::Registry for the HelloWorld Scripts.

 -Improved linking for the online site documentation,
  where a few links before were bad. </pre></font>

 ++20%+ faster startup script execution, as measured by the
  HelloWorld bench.  I cut a lot of the fat out of
  the code, and is now at least 20% faster on startup
  both with and without state.

  On my dev (NT,apache 1.3.6+<a href=http://perl.apache.org>mod_perl</a>) machine, I now get:

	42 hits per sec on Apache::ASP HelloWorld bench
	46 hits per sec on Embperl (1.2b10) and
	51 hits per sec for <a href=cgi.html>CGI</a> Apache::Registry scripts

  Before Apache::ASP was clocking some 31 hits per sec.
  Apache::ASP also went from 75 to 102 hits per second
  on Solaris.

 +PerlTaintCheck On friendly.  This is <a href=http://perl.apache.org>mod_perl</a>'s way
  of providing -T taint checking.  When Apache::ASP
  is used with state objects like $Session or $Application,
  MLDBM must also be made taint friendly with:

    $MLDBM::RemoveTaint = 1;

  which could be put in the global.asa.  Documented.

 +Added $Response-&gt;ErrorDocument($error_code, $uri_or_string)
  API extension which allows for setting of Apache's error
  document at runtime.  This is really just a wrapper
  for Apache-&gt;custom_response() renamed so it syncs with
  the Apache ErrorDocument config setting.  Updated
  documentation, and added error_document.htm example.

 =OrderCollections setting was added, but then REMOVED
  because it was not going to be used.  It bound
  $Request-&gt;* collections/hashes to Tie::IxHash, so that data
  in those collections would be read in the order the
  browser sent it, when eaching through or with keys.

 -global.asa will be reloaded when changed.  This broke
  when I optimized the modification times with (stat($file))[9]
  rather than &quot;use File::stat; stat($file)-&gt;mtime&quot;

 -Make Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() PerlRestartHandler safe,
  had some unstrict code that was doing the wrong thing.

 -IncludesDir config now works with DynamicIncludes.

 +DebugBufferLength feature added, giving control to
  how much buffered output get's shown when debugging errors.

 ++Tuning of $Response-&gt;Write(), which processes all
  static html internally, to be almost 50% faster for
  its typical use, when BufferingOn is enabled, and
  CgiHeaders are disabled, both being defaults.

  This can show significant speed improvements for tight
  loops that render ASP output.

 +Auto linking of <a href=eg/.*>./site/eg/.*</a> text to example scripts
  at web site.

 +$Application-&gt;GetSession($session_id) API extension, useful
  for managing active user sessions when storing session ids
  in $Application.  Documented.

 -disable use of flock() on Win95/98 where it is unimplemented

 -@array context of $Request-&gt;Form('name') returns
  undef when value for 'name' is undefined.  Put extra
  logic in there to make sure this happens. </pre></font>

<font face="lucida console,courier new" size=3><pre>
 -$Response-&gt;{Buffer} and PerlSetVar BufferingOn
  configs now work when set to 0, to unbuffer output,
  and send it out to the web client as the script generates it.

  Buffering is enabled by default, as it is faster, and
  allows a script to error cleanly in the middle of execution.

 +more bullet proof loading of Apache::Symbol, changed the
  way Apache::ASP loads modules in general.  It used to
  check for the module to load every time, if it hadn't loaded
  successfully before, but now it just tries once per httpd,
  so the web server will have to be restarted to see new installed
  modules.  This is just for modules that Apache::ASP relies on.

  Old modules that are changed or updated with an installation
  are still reloaded with the StatINC settings if so configured.

 +ASP web site wraps &lt;font face=&quot;courier new&quot;&gt; around &lt;pre&gt;
  tags now to override the other font used for the text
  areas.  The spacing was all weird in Netscape before
  for &lt;pre&gt; sections.

 -Fixed Content-Length calculation when using the Clean
  option, so that the length is calculated after the HTML
  is clean, not before.  This would cause a browser to
  hang sometimes.

 +Added IncludesDir config option that if set will also be
  used to check for includes, so that includes may easily be
  shared between applications.  By default only Global and
  the directory the script is in are checked for includes.

  Also added IncludesDir as a possible configuration option
  for Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader()

 -Re-enabled the Application_OnStart &amp; OnEnd events, after
  breaking them when implementing the AllowApplicationState
  config setting.

 +Better pre-fork cacheing ... StatINC &amp; StatINCMatch are now
  args for Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader(), so StatINC symbols loading
  may be done pre-fork and shared between httpds.  This lowers
  the child httpd init cost of StatINC.  Documented.

 +Made Apache::ASP Basic Authorization friendly so authentication
  can be handled by ASP scripts.  If AuthName and AuthType Apache
  config directives are set, and a $Response-&gt;{Status} is set to
  401, a user will be prompted for username/password authentication
  and the entered data will show up in ServerVariables as:
    $env = $Request-&gt;ServerVariables
    $env-&gt;{REMOTE_USER} = $env-&gt;{AUTH_USER} = username
    $env-&gt;{AUTH_PASSWD} = password
    $env-&gt;{AUTH_NAME}   = your realm
    $env-&gt;{AUTH_TYPE}   = 'Basic'

  This is the same place to find auth data as if Apache had some
  authentication handler deal with the auth phase separately.

 -MailErrorsTo should report the right file now that generates
  the error. </pre></font>

<font face="lucida console,courier new" size=3><pre>
 --State databases like $Session, $Application are
  now tied/untied to every lock/unlock triggered by read/write
  access.  This was necessary for correctness issues, so that
  database file handles are flushed appropriately between writes
  in a highly concurrent multi-process environment.

  This problem raised its ugly head because under high volume,
  a DB_File can become corrupt if not flushed correctly.
  Unfortunately, there is no way to flush SDBM_Files &amp; DB_Files
  consistently other than to tie/untie the databases every access.

  DB_File may be used optionally for StateDB, but the default is
  to use SDBM_File which is much faster, but limited to 1024 byte
  key/value pairs.

  For SDBM_Files before, if there were too many concurrent
  writes to a shared database like $Application, some of the
  writes would not be saved because another process
  might overwrite the changes with its own.

  There is now a 10 fold performance DECREASE associated
  with reading from and writing to files like $Session
  and $Application.  With rough benchmarks I can get about
  100 increments (++) now per second to $Session-&gt;{count}, where
  before I could get 1000 increments / second.

  You can improve this if you have many reads / writes happening
  at the same time, by placing locking code around the group like

	$Session-&gt;Lock();
	$Session-&gt;{count}++;
	$Session-&gt;{count}++;
	$Session-&gt;{count}++;
	$Session-&gt;UnLock();

  This method will reduce the number of ties to the $Session database
  from 6 to 1 for this kind of code, and will improve the performance
  dramatically.

  Also, instead of using explicit $Session locking, you can
  create an automatic lock on $Session per script by setting
  SessionSerialize in your config to 1.  The danger here is
  if you have any long running scripts, the user will have
  to wait for it to finish before another script can be run.

  To see the number of lock/unlocks or ties/unties to each database
  during a script execution, look at the last lines of debug output
  to your error log when Debug is set to 1.  This can help you
  perfomance tweak access to these databases.

 +Updated documentation with new config settings and
  API extensions.

 +Added AllowApplicationState config option which allows
  you to leave $Application undefined, and will not
  execute Application_OnStart or Application_OnEnd.
  This can be a slight performance increase of 2-3% if
  you are not using $Application, but are using $Session.

 +Added $Session-&gt;Lock() / $Session-&gt;UnLock() API routines
  necessary additions since access to session is not
  serialized by default like <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/iis/>IIS</a> ASP.  Also prompted
  by change in locking code which retied to SDBM_File
  or DB_File each lock.  If you $Session-&gt;Lock / UnLock
  around many read/writes, you will increase performance.

 +Added StateCache config which, if set will cache
  the file handle locks for $Application and an internal
  database used for tracking $Session info.  This caching can
  make an ASP application perform up to 10% faster,
  at a cost of each web server process holding 2 more
  cached file handles open, per ASP application using
  this configuration.  The data written to or read from
  these state databases is not cached, just the locking
  file handles are held open.

 -Added in much more locking in session manager
  and session garbage collector to help avoid collisions
  between the two.  There were definate windows that the
  two would collide in, during which bad things could
  happen on a high volume site.

 -Fixed some warnings in DESTROY and ParseParams() </pre></font>

 -<a href=cgi.html>CGI</a> &amp; StatINC or StatINCMatch would have bad results
  at times, with StatINC deleting dynamically compiled
  <a href=cgi.html>CGI</a> subroutines, that were imported into other scripts
  and modules namespaces.

  A couple tweaks, and now StatINC &amp; <a href=cgi.html>CGI</a> play nice again ;)
  StatINCMatch should be safe to use in production with <a href=cgi.html>CGI</a>.
  This affects in particular environments that use file upload,
  since <a href=cgi.html>CGI</a> is loaded automatically by Apache::ASP to handle
  file uploads.

  This fix should also affect other seemingly random
  times when StatINC or StatINCMatch don't seem to do
  the right thing.

 +use of ASP objects like $Response are now &quot;use strict&quot;
  safe in scripts, while UniquePackages config is set.

 +Better handling of &quot;use strict&quot; errors in ASP scripts.
  The error is detected, and the developer is pointed to the
  Apache error log for the exact error.

  The script with &quot;use strict&quot; errors will be recompiled again.  Its seems
  though that &quot;use strict&quot; will only throw its error once, so that a script
  can be recompiled with the same errors, and work w/o any use strict
  error messaging. </pre></font>

 -Compiles are now 10 +times faster for scripts with lots of big
  embedded perl blocks &lt;% #perl %&gt;

  Compiles were slow because of an old <a href=http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/>PerlScript</a> compatibility
  parsing trick where $Request-&gt;QueryString('hi')-&gt;{item}
  would be parsed to $Request-&gt;QueryString('hi') which works.
  I think the regexp that I was using had O(n^2) characteristics
  and it took a really big perl block to 10 +seconds to parse
  to understand there was a problem :(

  I doubt anyone needed this compatibility, I don't even see
  any code that looks like this in the online <a href=http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/>PerlScript</a> examples,
  so I've commented out this parsing trick for now.  If you
  need me to bring back this functionality, it will be in the
  form of a config setting.

  For information on <a href=http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/>PerlScript</a> compatibility, see the <a href=http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/>PerlScript</a>
  section in the ASP docs.

 -Added UniquePackages config option, that if set brings back
  the old method of compiling each ASP script into its own
  separate package.  As of v.10, scripts are compiled by default
  into the same package, so that scripts, dynamic includes &amp; global.asa
  can share globals.  This BROKE scripts in the same ASP Application
  that defined the same sub routines, as their subs would redefine
  each other.

  UniquePackages has scripts compiled into separate perl packages,
  so they may define subs with the same name, w/o fear of overlap.
  Under this settings, scripts will not be able to share globals.

 -Secure field for cookies in $Response-&gt;Cookies() must be TRUE to
  force cookie to be secure.  Before, it just had to be defined,
  which gave wrong behavior for Secure =&gt; 0.

 +$Response-&gt;{IsClientConnected} set to one by default.  Will
  work out a real value when I upgrade to apache 1.3.6.  This
  value has no meaning before, as apache aborts the perl code
  when a client drops its connection in earlier versions.

 +Lots of documentation updates

 +The MailHost config option is the smtp server used for
  relay emails for the Mail* config options.

 +MailAlertTo config option used for sending a short administrative
  alert for an internal ASP error, server code 500.  This is the
  compliment to MailErrorsTo, but is suited for sending a to a
  small text based pager.  The email sent by MailErrorsTo would
  then be checked by the web admin for quick response &amp; debugging
  for the incident.

  The MailAlertPeriod config specifies the time in minutes during
  which only one alert will be sent, which defaults to 20.

 +MailErrorsTo config options sends the results of a 500 error
  to the email address specified as if Debug were set to 2.
  If Debug 2 is set, this config will not be on, as it is
  for production use only.  Debug settings less than 2 only
  log errors to the apache server error log.

 -StatINCMatch / StatINC can be used in production and work
  even after a server graceful restart, which is essential for
  a production server.

 -Content-Length header is set again, if BufferingOn is set, and
  haven't $Response-&gt;Flush()'d.  This broke when I introduce
  the Script_OnEnd event handler.

 +Optimized reloading of the GlobalPackage perl module upon changes,
  so that scripts and dynamic includes don't have to be recompiled.
  The global.asa will still have to be though.  Since we started
  compiling all routines into a package that can be named with
  GlobalPackage, we've been undef'ing compiled scripts and includes
  when the real GlobalPackage changed on disk, as we do a full sweep
  through the namespace.  Now, we skip those subs that we know to
  be includes or scripts.

 -Using Apache::Symbol::undef() to undefine precompiled scripts
  and includes when reloading those scripts.  Doing just an undef()
  would sometimes result in an &quot;active subroutine undef&quot; error.
  This bug came out when I started thrashing the StatINC system
  for production use.

 +StatINCMatch setting created for production use reloading of
  perl modules.  StatINCMatch allows StatINC reloading of a
  subset of all the modules defined in %INC, those that match
  $module =~ /$StatINCMatch/, where module is some module name
  like Class/Struct.pm

 +Reoptimized pod comment parsing.  I slowed it down to sync
  lines numbers in the last version, but found another corner I could cut. </pre></font>

 += improvement; - = bug fix

 +Added index.html file to ./eg to help people wade through
  the examples.  This one has been long overdue.

 +Clean config option, or setting $Response-&gt;{Clean} to 1 - 9,
  uses HTML::Clean to compress text/html output of ASP scripts.
  I like the Clean 1 setting which is lightweight, stripping
  whitespace for about 10% compression, at a cost of less than
  a 5% performance penalty.

 +Using pod style commenting no longer confuses the line
  numbering.  ASP script line numbers are almost exactly match
  their compiled perl version, except that normal inline includes
  (not dynamic) insert extra text which can confuse line numbering.
  If you want perl error line numbers to entirely sync with your
  ASP scripts, I would suggest learning how to use dynamic includes,
  as opposed to inline includes.

 -Wrapped StatINC reloading of libs in an eval, and capturing
  error for Debug 2 setting.  This makes changing libs with StatINC
  on a little more friendly when there are errors.

 -$Request-&gt;QueryString() now stores multiple values for the
  same key, just as $Request-&gt;Form() has since v.07.  In
  wantarray() context like @vals = $Request-&gt;QueryString('dupkey'),
  @vals will store whatever values where associated with dupkey
  in the query string like (1,2) from: ?dupkey=1&amp;dupkey=2

 +The GlobalPackage config directive may be defined
  to explicitly set the perl module that all scripts and global.asa
  are compiled into.

 -Dynamic includes may be in the Global directory, just like
  normal includes.

 +Perl script generated from asp scripts should match line
  for line, seen in errors, except when using inline (default)
  includes, pod comments, or &lt;% #comment %&gt; perl comments, which
  will throw off the line counts by adding text, removing
  text, or having an extra newline added, respectively.

 -Script_OnEnd may now send output to the browser.  Before
  $main::Response-&gt;End() was being called at the end of the
  main script preventing further output.
</pre></font>++All scripts are compiled as routines in a namespace uniquely
<font face="lucida console,courier new" size=3><pre>  defined by the global.asa of the ASP application.  Thus,
  scripts, includes, and global.asa routines will share
  all globals defined in the global.asa namespace.   This means
  that globals between scripts will be shared, and globals
  defined in a global.asa will be available to scripts.

  Scripts used to have their own namespace, thus globals
  were not shared between them.

 +a -o $output_dir switch on the ./cgi/asp script allows
  it to execute scripts and write their output to an output
  directory.  Useful for building static html sites, based on
  asp scripts.  An example use would be:

    asp -b -o out *.asp

  Without an output dir, script output is written to STDOUT </pre></font>

 +Improved docs on $Response-&gt;Cookies() and $Request-&gt;Cookies()

 +Added PERFORMANCE doc to main README, and added sub section
  on precompiling scripts with Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader()

 +Naming of CompileIncludes switched over to DynamicIncludes
  for greater clarity.

 +Dynamic includes can now reference ASP objects like $Session
  w/o the $main::* syntax.  These subs are no longer anonymous
  subs, and are now compiled into the namespace of the global.asa package.

 +Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() precompiles dynamic includes too. Making this work
  required fixing some subtle bugs / dependencies in the compiling process.

 +Added Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() similar to Apache::RegistryLoader for
  precompiling ASP scripts.  Precompile a whole site at server
  startup with one function call.

 +Prettied the error messaging with Debug 2.

 +$Response-&gt;Debug(@args) debugging extension, which
  allows a developer to hook into the module's debugging,
  and only have @args be written to error_log when Debug is greater
  than 0.

 -Put write locking code around State writes, like $Session
  and $Application.  I thought I fixed this bug a while ago.

 -API change: converted $Session-&gt;Timeout() and $Session-&gt;SessionID()
  methods into $Session-&gt;{Timeout} and $Session-&gt;{SessionID} properties.
  The use of these properties as methods is deprecated, but
  backwards compatibility will remain.  Updated ./eg/session.asp
  to use these new properties.

 +Implemented $Response-&gt;{PICS} which if set sends out a PICS-Label
  HTTP header, useful for ratings.

 +Implemented $Response-&gt;{CacheControl} and $Response-&gt;{Charset} members.
  By default, CacheControl is 'private', and this value gets sent out
  every request as HTTP header Cache-Control.  Charset appends itself
  onto the content type header.

 +Implemented $Request-&gt;BinaryRead(), $Request-&gt;{TotalBytes},
  documented them, and updated ./eg/form.asp for an example usage.

 +Implemented $Response-&gt;BinaryWrite(), documented, and created
  and example in ./eg/binary_write.htm

 +Implemented $Server-&gt;MapPath() and created example of its use
  in ./eg/server.htm

 -$Request-&gt;Form() now reads file uploads correctly with
  the latest <a href=cgi.html>CGI</a>.pm, where $Request-&gt;Form('file_field') returns
  the actual file name uploaded, which can be used as a file handle
  to read in the data.  Before, $Request-&gt;Form('file_field') would
  return a glob that looks like *Fh::filename, so to get the file
  name, you would have to parse it like =~ s/^\*Fh\:\://,
  which you no longer have to do.  As long as parsing was done as
  mentioned, the change should be backwards compatible.

 +Updated  +enhanced documentation on file uploads.  Created extra
  comments about it as an <a href=faq.html>FAQ</a>, and under $Response-&gt;Form(), the latter
  being an obvious place for a developer to look for it.

 +Updated ./eg/file_upload.asp to show use of non file form data,
  with which we had a bug before.

 +Finished retieing *STDIN to cached STDIN contents, so that
  <a href=cgi.html>CGI</a> input routines may be used transparently, along side with
  use of $Request-&gt;Form()

 +Cleaned up and optimized $Request code

 +Updated documentation for <a href=cgi.html>CGI</a> input &amp; file uploads.  Created
  file upload <a href=faq.html>FAQ</a>.

 +Reworked ./eg/cgi.htm example to use <a href=cgi.html>CGI</a> input routines
  after doing a native read of STDIN.

 ++Added dynamic includes with &lt;!--include file=file args=@args--&gt;
  extension.  This style of include is compiled as an anonymous sub &amp;
  cached, and then executed with @args passed to the subroutine for
  execution.  This is include may also be rewritten as a new API
  extension: $Response-&gt;Include('file', @args)

 +Added ./eg/compiled_includes.htm example documenting new dynamic includes.

 +Documented <a href=ssi.html>SSI</a>: native file includes, and the rest with filtering
  to Apache::<a href=ssi.html>SSI</a>

 +Turned the documentation of Filter config to value of Off so
  people won't cut and paste the On config by default.

 +Added SecureSession config option, which forces session cookie to
  be sent only under https secured www page requests.

 +Added StateDB config option allows use of DB_File for $Session, since
  default use of SDBM_File is limited.  See StateDB in README.

 +file include syntax w/o quotes supported like &lt;!--#include file=test.inc--&gt;

 +Nested includes are supported, with includes including each other.
  Recursive includes are detected and errors out when an include has been
  included 100 times for a script.  Better to quit early than
  have a process spin out of control. (PORTABLE ? probably not)

 +Allow &lt;!--include file=file.inc--&gt; notation w/o quotes around file names

 -PerlSetEnv apache conf setting now get passed through to $Request-&gt;ServerVariables.

 +$Response-&gt;Write() prints scalars, arrays, and hashes.  Before only scalars.

 +Begin implementation of $Server object.

 +Implemented $Response-&gt;{Expires} and $Response-&gt;{ExpiresAbsolute}

 +Added &quot;PerlSetVar StatINC&quot; config option

 +$0 is aliased to current script filename

 +ASP Objects ($Response, etc.) are set in main package
  Thus notation like $main::Response-&gt;Write() can be used anywhere. </pre></font>

 ++Session Manager, won't break under denial of service attack

 +Fleshed out $Response, $Session objects, almost full implementation.

 +Enormously more documentation.

 -Fixed error handling with Debug = 2.

 -Documentation fixed for pod2man support.  README now more man-like.

 -Stripped \r\n dos characters from installation files

 -755 mode set for session state directory when created

 -Loads Win32/OLE properly, won't break with UNIX </pre></font>

 Syntax Support
 --------------
 Intial realease, could be considered alpha software.
 Allows developers to embed perl in html ASP style.

 &lt;!-- sample here --&gt;
 &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;% for(1..10) { %&gt;
 	counting: &lt;%=$_%&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;% } %&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;

 ASP Objects
 -----------
 $Session, $Application, $Response, $Request objects available
 for use in asp pages.

 $Session &amp; $Application data is preserved using SDBM files.

 $Session id's are tracked through the use of cookies.

 Security
 --------
 Timeouts any attempt to use a session id that doesn't already
 exist.  Should stop hackers, since there is no wire speed guessing
 cookies. </pre></font>
