</pre>=head2 CGI
<pre>
</pre>CGI has been the standard way of deploying web applications long before
ASP came along.  CGI.pm is a very useful module that aids developers in 
the building of these applications, and Apache::ASP has been made to 
be compatible with function calls in CGI.pm.  Please see cgi.htm in the 
./eg directory for a sample ASP script written almost entirely in CGI.
<pre>
</pre>As of version 0.09, use of CGI.pm for both input and output is seemless
when working under Apache::ASP.  Thus if you would like to port existing
CGI scripts over to Apache::ASP, all you need to do is wrap &lt;% %&gt; around
the script to get going.  This functionality has been implemented so that
developers may have the best of both worlds when building their 
web applications.
<pre>
</pre>Following are some special notes with respect to compatibility with CGI.
Use of CGI.pm in any of these ways was made possible through a great
amount of work, and is not gauranteed to be portable with other perl ASP
implementations, as other ASP implementations will likely be more limited.</td>
