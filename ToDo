- GLOBAL.ASA support
- Performance tuning (clients & server running on same machine)
	- 11 pages served / sec on WinNT PII 300 
		: with session management 
		: AllowSessionState 1
	- 16 pages served / sec on WinNT PII 300 
		: without state (no $Session, $Application)
		: NoState 1
	- 25 pages served / sec on WinNT PII 300 
		: static html (control)

	** NOTE: Users should expect a real application to deliver
	   a little over half the above performance, do to 
	   script processing time.  Tests where run on a minimal script.

	- 7  pages served / sec on WinNT PII 300 
		: with session management

		: real web application logic
	- 10 pages served / sec on WinNT PII 300
		: without state files
