IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
=======================
There is no specific time frame in which these things will be 
implemented.  Please let me know if any of these is of particular
interest to you, and I will give it higher priority.

WILL BE DONE 
============
- Full SSI with Apache::SSI chaining
- General PerlScript porting work.
	: Working toward compliance with PerlScript doc at
	  http://www.fastnetltd.ndirect.co.uk/Perl/Articles/PSIntro.html
	: Collection emulator will be a good place to start, just bless
	  a hash into a Collection object so there won't be a performace
	  penalty for all who don't care for this feature.
- Full CGI.pm scripting support in asp
	: $query = new CGI() automagically reads from Form or QueryString objects
	  Might need to cache STDIN for this.
	: $query = new CGI({}) or $query = new CGI($Request->Form())
	  syntax already supported as well as "print $query->popup_menu();" 
- Cache Scripts LRU style, so large sites won't choke server
- asp.pl, CGI method of doing asp
- GLOBAL.ASA support

MAY BE DONE
===========
- VBScript, ECMAScript interpreters
- use Http::Session for session management
- Integration with HTML::Embed
